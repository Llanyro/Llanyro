### Llanyro here!
Software engineer with mention in cybersecurity
I usually use:<br/>
C / C++ (Fast + control everything)<br/>
Assembly (FASTER! && die)<br/>
Python3 (Script and import everything fast)<br/>
Java(If i want to die doing Minecraft mods)<br/>

I try not to break Windows, but Windows loves me.
Somtimes I do software that can be used in pentesting and internal audits.
